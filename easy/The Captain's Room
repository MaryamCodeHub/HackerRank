## Problem Description
#Mr. Anant Asankhya manages the INFINITE Hotel, which has an infinite number of rooms. One day, a finite number of tourists arrive, consisting of:
#One Captain, who is assigned a unique room
#Multiple families, where each family consists of k members
#Each family is assigned one room per group
#You are given an unordered list of room numbers.
#Each family’s room number appears exactly k times, while the Captain’s room number appears only once.
#Your task is to identify and print the Captain’s room number.

k = int(input())                      # size of each group
room_list = list(map(int, input().split()))

for room in room_list:
    total = room_list.count(room)
    if total != k:
        print(room)
        break
